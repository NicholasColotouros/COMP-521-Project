# COMP-521-Project

A research project for COMP 521 (Modern Computer Games) that explores the various aspects of terrain analysis, artificial intelligence and influence maps in the context of a simplified RTS game.

The influence map visualized on top of the terrain (visualization can be disabled) has red marked as danger and blue marked as safe.

A prototype of this game was created for McGill game jam and was subsequently scrapped and redesigned. You can find that prototype in the Game Jam branch.

**Heat map representation:** 

The heat map goes from dark blue (super safe/favourable) to white (neutral/no heat) to dark red (super dangerous).

##TODO 
###WRITE THE 5-7 PAGE REPORT WITH GRAPHS AND FIGURES AND ANALYSIS AND CITATIONS


Remember: this is a research paper, we need to cite so make sure there's a paper that has something similar we can reference.


**AI:**
- Decide whether or not it will be 2 AIs or 1 AI and 1 human player doing specific actions 
  - The second AI can be completely stupid doing control actions on each map
  - Or we could just have human input doing that
- Make the AI


**GAMEPLAY:**
- Make Levels
- Decide how movement is done (ties into AI)
- Test shooting across multiple heights
- Figure out good values for displaying the heat in the Terrain Manager


**INFLUENCE MAPS:**
- Fix terrain height modifications
- Test having multiple units


**Terrain Analysis:**
- Dynamic Terrain analysis on height
- (if possible) Identify choke points
- (if possible) Do the same using visibility

**OTHER:**
- Hunt down those pesky TODO comments I may have forgotten about and make sure they're done.
