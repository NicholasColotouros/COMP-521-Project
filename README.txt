Builds have been made for AI vs AI in all 3 scenes as these are the most interesting scenarios.

Unfortunately, the build for scene 2 does not work correctly although it does in the editor.

Because there are different parametre settings that one can choose from, we have decided to include an exported package to ease evaluation and testing.


There are two prefabs, red and blue bots.

In order to change which script drives their AI, either the "Unit Controller" script or "Naive"  can be active (not both!).

After choosing which script to play from, press "apply" in the top right button in the prefab option bar. This will apply the changes to all the prefab instances.

In the inspector tab, there is a checkbox for "Cheating" at the "Naive" script component. 

This checkbox can be used to toggle wether or not the Naive script is cheating or not.
